# [Gamestate Integration File](gamestate_integration_v1.cfg)
This GSI file is merged between the reccomended config of both CS2 and DOTA2 in order to start reverse documenting and using Deadlocks GSI once it's functional.

## Deadlock GSI is yet to be released to my knowledge.
This is preparatory for when any portion of it becomes functional.
